    Aziz is a unique case because he was ultimately charged guilty for rioting with weapons and sentenced to 3 years of jail.
    However, during the court trial, he defended himself by saying he could not possibly join the riot because he could not see without his glasses.
    His defence was revoked eventually due to multiple witnesses testifying his participation in the riot.
